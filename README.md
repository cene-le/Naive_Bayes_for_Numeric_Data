# Naive_Bayes_for_Numeric_Data
## Experimental analysis of Naive Bayes accuracy on datasets that have numerical variables

## Dataset Description:
- **Data source:** [Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vikrishnan/iris-dataset)


## Goals:
The primary goal of our experiment, titled "Naive Bayes for Numeric Data: A Practical Guide," is to showcase the practical application of the Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) algorithm on a dataset composed predominantly of numerical features. 

In doing so, we aim to provide a step-by-step demonstration of how GNB can be effectively employed to classify data, specifically highlighting its ability to handle continuous numeric variables. This will involve preparing the data by assessing its distribution, applying the Gaussian probability density function to estimate the likelihood of each class given the input variables, and subsequently training the GNB model.

Furthermore, we will delve into the nuances of parameter estimation, discussing the calculation of means and variances for each class and feature, and explaining how these statistical measures influence the prediction process. By the end of this practical guide, the reader should gain a clear understanding of the GNB algorithm's implementation and its application in scenarios where numerical data prevails.


The following is a brief overview of the modeling steps.
